# CG2271: Real-Time Operating Systems Robotic Car Project

## Project Overview

This project, developed as part of the CG2271 course at NUS, involves creating a robotic car controlled via a controller. 
The goal is to apply real-time operating system (RTOS) principles to build a system that demonstrates critical features 
such as movement control, LED signaling, and audio feedback.

### Features

- **Connectivity**: Establishes a Bluetooth connection with a controller.
- **Command Execution**: Receives and executes commands from the control device, allowing the car to move in multiple directions.
- **LED Control**: Uses LED indicators to reflect the car's status, including motion and stationary states.
- **Audio Feedback**: Plays different sounds or tunes according to the car's status, enhancing user interaction.

### Hardware requirements

- ESP32 Module
- [H-Bridge Motor Drivers](https://www.pololu.com/product/2130))
- Android App/Controller
- FRDM-KL25Z
- LEDs
- Motors
